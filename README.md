# MVA_DL_TP1

This repo contains a jupyter notebook for the first TP. I added some functions to mpl.py but not modified the initial ones. In particular, some functions have been added for the denoising part. For each network is available a file ```.h5``` to load the model, and also pickle objects with the callbacks.
